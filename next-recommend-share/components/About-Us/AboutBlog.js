                            <p>
                                I aim to make a difference in the lives of genuine people and
                                businesses, creating an environment that allows them to thrive by
                                forming Transparency, Recognition and Accountability for everybody to
                                see.

                            <h1>My&nbsp;Story</h1>
                            <p>
                                Recommend and Share was born through the experiences in business of
                                its CEO and founder, Garry Lewis, who had been a victim of fraud and
                                found that the legal system and the police system didn’t work for the
                                victims. As a result,&nbsp; this had a devastating affect on his
                                family as he ended up losing everything he had worked for at the hands
                                of dishonest people, unscrupulous businessmen and Ltd companies, who
                                simply played the system for their own financial gains.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a tradesperson himself, he could relate to the problems in his
                                industry with rogue traders and rogue customers. Due to his own
                                experiences he decided to do something about it in order to try and
                                help protect other people going through the same experiences, of which
                                he still continues to suffer the consequences to this day.
                                <br />
                                That "something" became Recommend &amp; Share: a new environment that
                                gives people and businesses a voice, allowing them to share their
                                experiences and making everybody accountable for their actions for
                                everybody to see.
                                <br />
                                Recommend &amp; Share encourages both consumers and tradespeople to
                                show one another their intentions are genuine and honourable from the
                                outset, before committing to each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Recommend &amp; Share also allows both parties to check each other’s
                                history of recommendations before making a commitment. This will help
                                to create a better and safer environment for the UK and encourages
                                people to think twice about their actions.&nbsp;

                            <h1>Our Ethos</h1>
                            <p>
                                At Recommend &amp; Share, we believe in creating a society of people
                                who are proud to stand out and show one another that their intentions
                                are genuine and honourable in order create a better and safer
                                environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike directory sites, we don't charge tradespeople for using our
                                service, meaning we can stay completely neutral. The platform will
                                always remain free for everybody. Homeowners can rate a tradesperson,
                                and the tradesperson can rate them back, promoting a more respectful
                                ethos across the board. If we all come together we can and will make a
                                difference.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can’t predict the future but we can be responsible for creating a
                                better future for our children.
